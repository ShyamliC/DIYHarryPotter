    <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Making wands is a tedious, but fun craft! While it's nearly impossible to create exact replicas of the wands from the movies of Harry Potter, you always end up surprising yourself nonetheless.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">I use three tools to make these awesome wands:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <font face="Trebuchet MS">
      <li>Chop sticks or skewers</li>
      <li>LOTS of hot glue (be careful!)</li>
      <li>Acrylic paint</li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">If you want to edit the length of your stick (I use skewers, and they are usually around 10 inches long), you can chop some off to make it shorter, or add more onto the end of the original one to make it longer. Keep in mind that if you do want to make your wand longer, you should try and find longer sticks due to the fact that the wand might be more wobbly if you add extensions. When you have the length of your wand ready, you can move onto the next step: HOT GLUE!</font><br><br></p>
    <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Personally, using the hot glue is my favorite part because I love watching the wand become more than a stick that could have food on it! The key is to put globs on the stick and use the edge of the hot glue gun to shape the glue into whatever you want. If you don't trust yourself with hot glue, you can just do little globs and wait for them to dry. This process is pretty slow, but it's a lot safer and it can make really cool and small details that big globs cannot produce. When you've finished and are content with the shape of your wand, you can start painting!</font><br><br></p>
    <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Painting is a really cool part because you get to see all of the little details that you created from the hot glue, and make the wand look real! Make sure that when you have finished with the hot glue, unplug it just to be safe and then make sure the wand is completely dry before painting. When you use colorful paint, you should start by giving your wand a nice white coat so the desired colors pop. To give more dimension, use different shades of paint, especially when you want to make your wand look like wood. And don't forget to have fun with this!</font><br><br></p>

    <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">Some tips to remember are don't be afraid to try new things, like breaking your wand to look crooked or anything else that might cross your mind. Keep in mind that there are endless possiblilities, and you should never give up on your wand. The wand chooses the wizard, and it deserves respect!</font></p>
